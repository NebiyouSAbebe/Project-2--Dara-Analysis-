# Introduction

Titanic created quite a stir when it departed for its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, on April 10,1912. After stops in Cherbourg, 
France, and Queenstown, Ireland, the ship set sail for New york with 891 passengers and crew the expression then used in the shipping 
inustry, usually in connection with a sinking-on board. Using the provide data set and knowledge gained from Udacity Data Analysis 
Nanodegree, I would like to factors made more to survive interms of :

1) Genders: Which genders survived with a higher count, Male or Female?
2) Pclass: Which Pclass survived the most ?, and
3) Ages: Which ages group survived the most?

Now, am currently using the Jupyter notebook, python and the number of libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn) gained 
knowldege from Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program.

         Data columns (total 12 columns):

# Exclude from the data analysis.

I am exclude Name,SibSp,Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin and Embarked. The reason I excluded these lists are:(f.ex.)the Name are specfic 
for individuals person's of first and last name.

In [3]: del df['Name']
        del df['SibSp']
        del df['Parch']
        del df['Ticket']
        del df['Fare']
        del df['Cabin']
        del df['Embarked']
        
# Sample Data into 2 samples

To decide should if I ignored the rows with the missing age or fill the missing values with the mean, first to split the sample 
data into two samples with filled age and without age.

# Does the sample have more filled with age or without age?

In [4]: with_age = df[df['Age'].notnull()]
        without_age = df[df['Age'].isnull()]
        
 
# t test for independent variables

To be able to ignore the data without the age, I should be sure that passengers in these two samples are likely to have the similar 
survival rate. As these are two independent 2 samples, t test for independent variables might help me. I'm using the existing in 
scipy.stats function to perform t test for independent variables.
       
In [5]: from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
        ttest_ind(with_age['Survived'], without_age['Survived'])
Out[5]:  Ttest_indResult(statistic=2.7606993230995345, pvalue=0.0058865348400755626)   

The result of the ttest shows the significant difference of considered samples. Consequently, I'm going to substitute the missing 
values with the mean age.

In[6]: df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean())
       df.info()
       
 <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890
Data columns (total 5 columns):
PassengerId    891 non-null int64
Survived       891 non-null int64
Pclass         891 non-null int64
Sex            891 non-null object
Age            891 non-null float64
dtypes: float64(1), int64(3), object(1)
memory usage: 34.9+ KB      

Now we can see that all columns have identical length. Let's see some descriptive statistics from built in the pandas library function 
describe.

# The gender and Pclass group

I would like to know more of how the survival rate depends from different independent variables. Am going to visualize the data 
using bar plots.

# Does female have more survived than male?
# Which part of classes are more likely to survived?

In[8]: %pylab inline
        import seaborn as sns
        sns.factorplot('Pclass','Survived',hue_order='Age',data=df, kind='bar')
        sns.factorplot("Sex",'Survived',hue_order="Sex",data=df,kind='bar')
        
Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib        
        
Out[8]: <seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x9e2bc18>

When am looking the above plots, it seems to me that females had more chances to survive than males, as well as the passengers of 
the first class had more chances than the passengers of the second class, and they had more chances than passengers of third class. 
So, the best place to survive is in the first class and be female.

# Age Group

Now, let's look at the distribution of ages within the groups we defined above. The age distribution of the passengers 
are shown below:

# Which ages group survived the most ?

In[1]: import seaborn as sns
       age_bins = np.arange(0,100,4)
       sns.distplot(df.loc[df['Survived']==0) & (df['Age'].isnull()),'Age'], bins=age_bins)
       sns.distplot(df.loc[df['Survived']==1) & (df['Age'].isnull()), 'Age'], bins=age_bins)
       plt.title ('age distribution among survival classes')
       plt.ylabel ('frequency')
       plt.legend(['did not survive', 'survived']);
File "<ipython-input-1-9bcd4a052c63>", line 3
    sns.distplot(df.loc[df['Survived']==0) & (df['Age'].isnull()),'Age'], bins=age_bins)

# Conclusion

In this project, the Titanic passenger data was analyzed to look at the factors related to the passenger's survivals. 
The two variables are considered in this project namely: gender and class. Most male survivors are children in the first class while 
for female, almost all age group in the first and second class have high survivor percentage. For both gender groups, a lot of 
casualties came from the third class. Regarding, the gender group anlysis, female have more survivor rate than male.

# Limitation of the study

It's important to identify and acknowledge the limitation of the study. 1) Correlation doesn't imply causation. 
My conclusions are based just on the provided data set. To get the real causation, I should conduct the controlled experiment which 
is most probably not possible. 2) Using sample instead of the population. It's known, that there were 1317 passengers and 885 crew 
members on the board of Titanik. Our data set represent just 891 persons. There is no clear mention of the crew members in the data 
set - so either they are not in the data set or they are hidden among the passengers of the 1, 2 and 3 classes. If the crew memebers 
are represented in our data set, the overal statistic might be distorted. 3) There are the variables that I don't analyse 
(Name, SibSp, Parch, cabin, Fare, and Embarked). These variables have bias (based on the description of the data; f.ex.: With 
respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch) some relations were ignored.) or significant amount of data is missed 
(like for Cabin). To avoid adding noice to the analysis, I've decided to exclude them from the analysis. 4) The dataset is filled with 
missing values of the age. The missing age values are imputed with the mean and here is the comparison between default 
(dropped missing values) and imputed age values.
